## Module: NIS2 Compliance Automation Bridge

**Architecture & Workflow**:
* **Source of Truth**: Asynchronous injection from a secured Gist via GitHub Actions.
* **Data Pipeline**: `nis2_compliance_bridge.py` Python script engineered for technical interoperability.
* **Security**: Authenticated via `GH_PAT` (Personal Access Token Classic) with full `repo` scope.
* **Scheduling**: Weekly automated updates (CRON) and manual trigger support (workflow_dispatch).

**Business Impact**:
* **Sovereignty**: Centralization of automation pipelines on a controlled Git infrastructure.

### 🛠️ Usage & Deployment

To trigger a manual synchronization of the compliance logic:

1. **Access Actions**: Navigate to the `Actions` tab of the repository.
2. **Select Workflow**: Click on `Gist-to-Repo Sync` from the left sidebar.
3. **Trigger**: Use the `Run workflow` dropdown and confirm the execution on the `main` branch.
4. **Validation**: Check for the green status icon (✅) indicating the successful bridge update.

*Note: Automated indexing occurs every Monday at midnight via CRON scheduling.*
